# titanic-EDA-task2

## Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns, trends, and relationships between features.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and inspected the dataset
2. Checked missing values
3. Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std)
4. Created histograms and boxplots
5. Performed correlation analysis
6. Identified patterns and trends
7. Wrote final conclusions

##  Key Observations
- Female passengers had higher survival rates.
- 1st class passengers survived more than 3rd class.
- Fare has a positive relationship with survival.
- Age had weaker impact compared to gender and class.
- Some outliers were found in Fare distribution.

##  Conclusion
Gender and passenger class were the strongest factors influencing survival. Socio-economic status played a major role in survival chances.

##  Dataset
Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
